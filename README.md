# Certificate Allocation Module
- CAM or certificate allocation module is a PowerShell module designed to facilitate the download and installation of certificates stored in Azure KeyVault primarily to production servers.

# Goals 
- Support certificate auto renewal through Key Vault supported Certificate Authorities. 
- Unify certificate download processes throughout multiple properties. 
- Allow properties to decouple certificate deployment and code deployment. 

# Auto renewal overview
- A certificate in the KeyVault reaches a pre-determined point in its lifetime where it is configured to make a request to SSLAdmin for renewal. 
- The certificate is renewed by SSLAdmin and put into the KeyVault.  

# Certificate download overview
- The CAM is run either during deployment of a new VM, or periodically through a scheduled task. 
- The CAM fetches its relevant manifest JSON file from the KeyVault. 
- The CAM reads the manifest and downloads all the certificates listed by default unless otherwise specified in the “deploy” property.  
- The CAM deletes certificates from the machine with the “deploy” property set to “false”. 

# CAM structure
- CAM.psm1 – The PowerShell module that houses the CAM’s functionality. 
- CAMConfig.json – The CAM’s configuration file. 
- CAMAuth.pfx – A certificate that the CAM uses to authenticate itself to AAD. 
- KeyVault – An Azure KeyVault that houses all the certificates for a specific service.  
- Manifest.json – A configuration file that is a whitelist of certificates to download to the VMs.

# Installation
Available on the [Powershell gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/CAM). Open a powershell window and execute:
```POWERSHELL
Install-Module -Name "CAM"
```

# Version + Updates
**1.6** You can now install just the public key of a certificate from Key Vault by adding the `"PublicKeyOnly":true` property to your Manifest. Alternatively if you are calling the cmdlets directly you would pass the `-PublicKeyOnly $true` parameter. Additionally, due to investigation into Key storage within Key Vault, certificates are now pulled using the Get-AzureKeyVaultSecret AzureRm cmdlet within the Install-KVCertificateObject cmdlet.

**1.5** You can now have limited information returned to you about an installed certificate when calling the `Install-KVCertificateObject` or `Install-KVSecretObject` cmdlets by passing the `-ReturnOutput` switch. Below is an example of the call and output:
```Powershell
>Install-KVCertificateObject -CertName "MyCertificate" -ReturnOutput
>CAM: Installed Certificate SSLAdmin to LocalMachine\My store

Name                           Value
----                           -----
FriendlyName                   MyCertificate
Thumbprint                     00001111222233334444555566667777888
```

**1.4** You can now override the defualt Key Vault certificates are pulled from by specifying an alternate vault in the Certificate Node as such:
```POWERSHELL
{
 "CertName":"MyAwesomeCert",
 "KeyVault":"MySecondaryKeyVault",
 "CertVersions":[{
  "Deploy":["True"]
 }]
}
```

**1.3** "Unstructured" property can now be set on certificates to denote that they are not structured in json as outlined in the Wiki. Additionally, the keyStorageFlags parameter was added to the Install-KVSecretObject function to let you set [storage flags](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.x509certificates.x509keystorageflags(v=vs.110).aspx) on installed certificates such as 'Exportable'.

**1.2** New function added "Grant-CertificateAccess" which grants certificate private key permissions to the supplied user. Adding the property "GrantAccess" in the manifest.json will trigger this function after certificate download. for example `"GrantAccess":"Network Service"`

**1.1** Including the StoreName and StoreLocation property is no longer required in the Manifest.json. If it is not provided, the module will default to downloading the certificate to the LocalMachine\My store.

**1.0** Initial release.
